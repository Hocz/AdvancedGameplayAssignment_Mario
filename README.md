Cover Letter: Advanced Gameplay Assignment - Mario

I chose the Mario project because of the games covered it is the one I can relate to the most and I've player most Mario games.

Considering the need of the Eventhandler and the use of it highly favoring turn-based games I decided to make a mixed style of Mario games.
I have the classic Mario style gameplay, a 2D platformer and if you engage an enemy the combat is turn-based, like in the paper mario games.

I made different game states, playing, combat, paused, etc. and depending on the gamestate the game would run relevant logic. 
So if the game was in the playing state the player and enemies can move freely.
When entering combat each action taken is an event, attack, block and heal.

Some of the challenges I had was in general incorporating the Eventhandler. 
More specifically I struggled a bit with having events run when I wanted and doing things in the right order. 
The way I solved events running at the right time was simply adding checks when needed.

Overall I found the incorporation of an Eventhandler fun but if I were to use it in the future I would only really use it for turn-based games were I could have more fun with it.
